MS Research Project - MedChat

SCOPE:
The primary aim of this research is to analyse and assess the performance and effectiveness of an open-source, small-scale LLM as a chatbot application within the medical domain. The study will explore the collaboration between chatbot functionality, open-source platforms, and the utilisation of small-scale LLMs in the medical landscape. This study seeks to determine the Generative AI's accuracy, reliability, and overall utility in providing medical information and support by employing a comprehensive dataset of medical terms and their corresponding explanations. The ultimate goal is to enhance the accessibility and quality of healthcare communication through cost-effective AI-driven solutions.

Two methods are employed to improve the performance of the medical chatbot model:

1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): This technique will be used to build the chatbot by retrieving relevant medical information from a knowledge base during the generation process.
2. Fine-tuning: The pre-trained LLM will be fine-tuned on the medical dataset to enhance its understanding of medical terminology and concepts.
