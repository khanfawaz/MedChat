MS Research Project - MedChat



SCOPE:
This research aims to analyse and assess the performance and effectiveness of an open-source, small-scale LLM as a chatbot application within the medical domain. The study will explore the collaboration between chatbot functionality, open-source platforms, and the utilisation of small-scale LLMs in the medical landscape leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and AI Agents. This study seeks to determine the Generative AI's accuracy, reliability, and utility in providing medical information and support by employing a comprehensive dataset of medical terms and their corresponding explanations. The ultimate goal is to enhance the accessibility and quality of healthcare communication through cost-effective AI-driven solutions.

Two methods are employed to improve the performance of the medical chatbot model:

1. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): This technique will be used to build the chatbot by retrieving relevant medical information from a knowledge base during the generation process.
2. 3. AI Agent: The AI agent will interact with its environment, collect data, and use the data to perform self-determined tasks to meet predetermined goals.
